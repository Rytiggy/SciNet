# SciNet
SciNet is an extension for chrome that scrapes the browser caches of the user who visited the journals for paper info. SciNet will then processes that info into a form our API can use.

How to use:
Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/

Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

Select the button "Load unpacked extension" and navigate the the folder named extension and select it.
